      <h2 id="about-me">About Me</h2>

<p>I am currently machine learning engineer at <a href="https://www.intellimize.com/">Intellimize</a>. I previously worked at Carnegie Mellon’s School of Computer Science focusing on various aspects of autonomous racing after starting and leading <a href="https://www.cmu.edu/news/stories/archives/2020/july/roborace.html">CMU’s Roborace team</a> following a master’s program.</p>

<p>My interests span broadly across various aspects of machine learning including building efficient machine learning systems.</p>

<h2 id="experience">Experience</h2>

<p>At Intellimize, I’ve worked on a variety of engineering and machine learning projects including building and shipping a <a href="https://www.intellimize.com/press/intellimize-releases-ai-powered-copy-suggestions-for-marketers-to-instantly-personalize-websites-that-convert-more">fully implicit text recommendation service</a> which provides text variations for any element on a website with no user input [<a href="https://www.linkedin.com/posts/intellimize_convertmore-writing-content-activity-6960991520355217408-iDxf?utm_source=linkedin_share&amp;utm_medium=member_desktop_web">example</a>].</p>

<p>At Carnegie Mellon, I built learn-to-race, a high-fidelity reinforcement learning and control environment, described below. I also was able to achieve near human speed performance in the environment by creating a custom off-policy, asynchronous distributed RL system and running large scale experiments on <a href="https://www.pdl.cmu.edu/index.shtml">CMU PDL’s</a> compute clusters.</p>

<p>Prior to graduate school, I worked as a pricing actuary working primarily on statistical modeling, and in the Spring of 2019, became an Associate of the Society of Actuaries. Additionally, I played professional footabll for the New York Giants in the preseason of 2017 as an outside linebacker.</p>

<p>J. Herman, J. Francis, S. Ganju, A. Koul, A. Skabelkin, I. Zhukov, A. Gostev, M. Kumskoy, E. Nyberg. <em>Learn-to-Race: A Multimodal Control Environment for Autonomous Racing.</em> Proceedings of the IEEE/CVF International Conference on Computer Vision (ICCV), 2021, pp. 9793-9802. [<a href="https://openaccess.thecvf.com/content/ICCV2021/html/Herman_Learn-To-Race_A_Multimodal_Control_Environment_for_Autonomous_Racing_ICCV_2021_paper.html">paper</a>] [<a href="https://github.com/learn-to-race/l2r">code</a>] [<a href="https://pypi.org/project/l2r/">PyPI</a>]</p>

<h2 id="learn-to-race">Learn-to-Race</h2>

<p>Inspired by many recent works using deep reinforcement learning to address highly complex problems, I created <a href="https://github.com/learn-to-race/l2r">learn-to-race</a>, an  OpenAI Gym compliant reinforcement learning &amp; control environment. This work has been featured in ICCV and was used in a <a href="https://learn-to-race.org/workshop-sl4ad-icml2022/">safe learning challenge at ICML</a>.</p>

<p><br /></p>

<p>I also wrote <a href="https://github.com/hermgerm29/distrib_l2r">distrib_l2r</a> which is a custom, Kubernetes-based distributed approach to training agents with the environment. In partnership with CMU’s Parallel Data Lab, I trained the following Soft Actor-Critic agent to learn-to-race, from scratch, after about 2 million timesteps in the environment.</p>
