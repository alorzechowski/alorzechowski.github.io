## About Me


I am currently a MPH Candidate at Columbia Mailman School of Public Health. My recent experience includes an internship in [TTi's](https://tti-research.com/) research consulting division and performing applied virology research at the University of Pittsburgh. 

My interests span broadly across various aspects infectious diseases, virology, and public health policy.


## Experience

At Intellimize, I've worked on a variety of engineering and machine learning projects including designing and shipping a [fully implicit text recommendation service](https://www.intellimize.com/press/intellimize-releases-ai-powered-copy-suggestions-for-marketers-to-instantly-personalize-websites-that-convert-more) which provides text variations for any element on a website with no user input \[[example](https://www.linkedin.com/posts/intellimize_convertmore-writing-content-activity-6960991520355217408-iDxf?utm_source=linkedin_share&utm_medium=member_desktop_web)\].

At Carnegie Mellon, I built learn-to-race, a high-fidelity reinforcement learning and control environment, described below, which was published at ICCV and featured in a [safe learning workshop at ICML](https://learn-to-race.org/workshop-sl4ad-icml2022/).

Prior to graduate school, I worked as a pricing actuary working primarily on statistical modeling, and in the Spring of 2019, became an Associate of the Society of Actuaries. Additionally, I played professional footabll for the New York Giants in the preseason of 2017 as an outside linebacker.

## Learn-to-Race

Inspired by many recent works using deep reinforcement learning to address highly complex problems, I created [learn-to-race](https://github.com/learn-to-race/l2r), an  OpenAI Gym compliant reinforcement learning & control environment. My hope is that the environment will help advance research in a variety of areas including safe reinforcement learning and multi-modal machine learning.

I also wrote [distrib_l2r](https://github.com/hermgerm29/distrib_l2r) which is a custom, Kubernetes-based distributed approach to training agents with the environment. I also was able to achieve near human speed performance in the environment by creating a custom off-policy, asynchronous distributed RL system and running large scale experiments on [CMU PDL's](https://www.pdl.cmu.edu/index.shtml) compute clusters.
