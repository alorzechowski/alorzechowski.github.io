## About Me


I am currently a MPH Candidate at Columbia Mailman School of Public Health graduating in May 2023. My recent experience includes an internship in [TTi Health Research & Economics](https://tti-research.com/) research consulting division and performing applied virology research at the University of Pittsburgh. 

My interests span broadly across various aspects infectious diseases, virology, pandemic preparedness, and public health policy.


## Experience

At TTi Health Research & Economics, I conducted literature reviews and data analyses for client-driven projects to summarize information on real-world application and market value of medical device technology. I prepared the results of research for publication in trade journals through manuscript development (currently awaiting publication). 

At Columbia University Mailman School of Public Health, I contributed to biomedical sensor development and grant funding proposals supporting Long COVID research and community outreach in the Washington Heights community in New York, NY. I reviewed and analyzed data on autonomic nervous system dysfunction, circadian rhythms, and biomarkers in Long COVID disease progression, in preparation for a graduate thesis. 

As a research technician at the University of Pittsburgh, I designed primers, cloned, and sequenced a panel of 35 chikungunya virus mutant stocks and redesigned ELISA assay protocol to reduce non-specific binding, yielding more accurate measures of attenuated viral binding and characterization. I also imaged in vitro viral infections via immunofluorescence to assess how cellular machinery mediates maturation of viral protein. 

At the University of Pittsburgh Behavioral Medicine Research Group, I led training sessions for study participants, collecting data on the association between diet, exercise, sleep, and stress on cardiovascular disease development in members of the Pittsburgh community. I conducted and presented an undergraduate thesis project specifically assessing the association between interpersonal stress on inflammation in midlife. 

At UPMC Childrenâ€™s Hospital, I performed MOI trials to characterize chikungunya viral infection of 14 mammalian and 8 mosquito cell lines. I also conducted plaque assay to assess viral titer in experimental samples at several time points post-infection. 

I studied comparative healthcare systems, environmental determinants of health, and emergency medicine in Mussoorie, India, gaining perspective on the Indian healthcare system hands-on working in several rural clinics in the foothills of the Himalayan Mountains. Conversely, as a CNA at the University of Pittsburgh Medical Center, I worked primarily in a highly-skilled nursing unit serving chronic disease patients by taking vitals, charting, and assisting residents with activities of daily living, observing the impact of chronic diseases on the US population and healthcare expenditure.
